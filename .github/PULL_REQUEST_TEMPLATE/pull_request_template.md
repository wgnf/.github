<!--
  First of all: Thanks a lot for creating this PR! It's awesome to see that you're contributing! ❤

  

  Please make sure that your PR is limited to one change at a time (documentation (documentation for a new feature is fine), feature implementation, bug fix, ...)!
  It's always easier to review a compact PR that focusses on one change only, than having to jump from one topic to another.

  If you want to do multiple things, consider opening multiple PRs!
